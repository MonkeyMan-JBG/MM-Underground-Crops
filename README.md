# Underground Crops 

Created alternate crops specifically for underground farming. Removed the natural sunlight requirement, so alternate crops can be grown underground.

All crops follow the standard vanilla progression, requiring to be unlocked with their normal counterparts using "Seed" Crafting skills. 
Underground super corn also follows the vanilla progression and is also unlocked with the Super Corn (Seed) Recipe.
